abstract = "Erythropoeisis is the process by which Red Blood Cells (RBCs) are formed from the mother cells (Stem Cells) inside the bone marrow.  RBCs contain Hemoglobin, oxygen carrier and are destroyed in the spleen and other reticulo-endothelial cells after a pre-determined time period due to shortening of their cell membranes. The model aims to describe the process of erythropoeisis in terms of differential equations.  We can combine various systems of erythropoeisis to understand dynamics of competing erythropoesis as seen in post bone marrow transplant settings."
