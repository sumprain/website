## Introduction

Using prediction nomogram is another way to apply the predictive model. You can download the nomogram as image file by right clicking the image and saving it and use it in your bedside by taking printouts of the same.

## How to use the nomogram

For each variable, get points by drawing a vertical line up from the value in variable axis to the point axis. Add all the points and draw a vertical line from Total Points axis down to the Linear Predictor axis and Predicted probability of AKI after 7 days axis to get the linear predictor and Predicted Probability.
