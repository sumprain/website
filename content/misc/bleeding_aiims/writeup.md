## Background

Based on the thrombotic potential, the processes in 
human body can be classified into **prothrombotic** and **antithrombotic**
processes.

The **prothrombotic processes** are needed to prevent
leakage of blood from the vasculature outside (bleeding) 
after its disruption.

The **antithrombotic processes** are needed to prevent blood 
form getting clotted inside intact vasculature.

### Prothrombotic process

The process consist of the tissue factor and vWF from the 
subendothelial layer; phospholipids from the platelets, 
erythrocytes and activated endothelium; activated platelets; 
coagulation factors and antifibrinolytic system (which prevents 
the fibrin degradation).

Activated endothelium and pro-inflammatory state is an important 
component of prothrombotic process.

Inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombocytosis, increased 
tissue factor, coagulation factors and vWF leads to prothrombotic 
state.

Arterial bed is a high flow bed and the thrombosis takes place 
with platelet activation and aggregation secondary to exposure 
to collagen and vWF from subendothelial system.

Venous bed is a low flow bed, in which thrombosis usually takes 
place due to stasis and abnormalities of coagulation (usually 
decreased anticoagulants).

### Antithrombotic process

Antithrombotic process is mediated primarily by the intact 
endothelium with anticoagulants, circulatory anticoagulants 
(Protein C/S complex and anti-thrombin), fibrinolytic mechanism, 
and pathological inhibitors against coagulation factors, platelet 
receptors and vWF.

Decreased platelets, decreased platelet functions, decreased 
coagulation factor activity/content, increased anticoagulants, 
circulating inhibitors against coagulation factors, vWF and 
platelet receptors are important causes for antithrombosis.

Antithrombosis leads to bleeding. Altered vessel wall integrity 
is an important component for bleeding.

## Discrepancy between different indicators of pro/anti-thrombotic process

When there is discrepancy between different indicators, 
diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma occurs as to the predominant 
process (pro or anti-thrombotic).

The following are the situations when there is discrepancy

### Syndrome of Endothelial Dysfunction (Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis)

Whenever there is endothelial dysfunction, there is activation 
and aggregation of platelets  leading to thrombocytopenia. 
The process of endothelial dysfunction leads to activation 
of pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic signals leading to 
thrombosis.

Ths above syndrome leads to the formation of Thrombotic Microangipathy 
which lead to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia 
and thrombosis.

The thrombocytopenia in this setting is usually mild to moderate 
(usually 30000 - 100000/cu mm), except in DIC where it can be less
than 20000/cu mm  also.

Thrombocytopenia is usually not treated as it is a reactionary 
process.

Other than bleeding variety of DIC, the other varieties 
are prothrombotic and platelet transfusion is usually contraindicated 
and there is role of anti coagulation in the management of the disease.

The important clinical situations in which above process occur are

1. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation:**  The endothelial 
dysfunction takes place due to excess tissue factor released 
in blood stream leading to the consumption of coagulation factors 
and platelets. In the milder form of DIC, which occurs early in 
course and is compensated, the excess activation of coagulation 
factors and platelets can lead to both macrovascular and microvascular 
thrombosis. In the full blown form of DIC, the body is not able to 
compensate for the loss of coagulation factors, which lead to 
a global decrease in coagulation factors and bleeding ensues.

1. **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura:** This syndrome complex is 
characterised by platelet plug formation due to decreased ADAMTS 13  
levels leading to failure of the ultralarge polymers of vWF 
to be cleaved. It leads to excessive platelet activation and 
endothelial dysfunction. Decreased ADAMTS 13 levels can 
be due to decreased production (hereditary) or due to 
antibody mediated increased clearance. It is characterised clinically by fever, 
renal failure, neurological dysfunction and normal coagulation parameters. 
Thrombosis usually occurs in microcirculation and arterial bed.
Plasmapharesis and plasma exchange with the aim to replace 
normal ADAMTS 13 and remove antibodies forms the mainstay of 
treatment. Platelets transfusions are contraindicated as they 
precipitate more platelet plug formation.

1. **Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis:** This 
syndrome is characterised by activating antibody formation 
against the platelet factor 4 - heparin complex after 
exposure to heparin. The antibody leads to platelets and 
endothelial activation. Clinically, it is characterised by 
thrombocytopenia and thrombotic manifestation (venous and 
arterial). Chances of development of the antibody is proportional 
to the molecular weight of heparin (increased with higher 
molecular weight heparin). The mainstay of treatment is withdrawal 
of heparin and replacement with other parenteral anticoagulants.

1. **Antiphospholipid Syndrome:** APS is characterised by the 
antibodies against antiphospholipids (which are present over 
platelets and endothelial cells), which lead to prothrombotic state 
with thrombocytopenia. The prothrombin time may be fallaciously 
increased due to in vitro affect of antiphospholid antibodies 
in conduct of the tests.

### Syndrome of acquired vWF deficiency

Thrombocytosis due to any reason is associated with increased 
incidence of arterial thrombosis. Excess circulating platelets 
lead to increased usage of vWF and it can lead to decreased 
circulating vWF. Paradoxically at platelets counts more than 
1000000/cu mm, chances of bleeding can be more.

Antiplatelets should be used with caution till the time platelets 
are reduced to less than 1000000/cu mm.

## Managing patients with bleeding and thrombosis

As a general rule, antiplatelets and anticoagulants are not 
given for patients with thrombosis (arterial or venous) if they 
have predominant anticoagulation milieu, like active bleeding, 
platelets less than 50000/cu mm and/or deranged coagulation 
parameters. In case of life threatening thrombosis, anticoagulants and 
antiplatelets can be started after correcting the anticoagulation milieu.

## Conclusion

The above write up deals with situations where there is discrepancy 
between various indicators of pro and anticoagulation. Managing such 
cases need high degree of clinical suspicion, delicate decision 
making and individualised treatment for achieving optimal outcome.
